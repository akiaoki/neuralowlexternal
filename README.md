# neuralowlexternal
This is an unfinished project.
I'm not going to finish this. This is the first and the last version of neuralowlexternal.

Before compiling the sources make sure you're using the latest signatures (signature scanning included). 
You can edit them in PointersManager.cs

I'm not responsible for everything you do with this project or for. This was only an attempt to understand how game cheats are structured. It should not be used for real hacking or selling, only for informative purposes.
